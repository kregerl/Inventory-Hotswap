1.19.x Changelog
41.0
====
 - 41.0.38 Fix SP-Devtime world loading crash due to missing server configs (#8757)
 - 41.0.37 Remove ForgeWorldPreset and related code (#8756)
           Vanilla has a working replacement.
 - 41.0.36 Change ConfigValue#get() to throw if called before config loaded  (#8236)
           This prevents silent issues where a mod gets the value of the setting
           before configs are loaded, which means the default value is always
           returned.
           As there may be situations where the getting the config setting before
           configs are loaded is needed, and it is not preferable to hardcode the
           default value, the original behavior is made available through #getRaw.
           Implements and closes #7716
           * Remove getRaw() method
           This is effectively replaced with the expression `spec.isLoaded() ?
           configValue.get() : configValue.getDefault()`.
           * Remove forceSystemNanoTime config setting
           As implemented, it never had any effect as any place where the config
           value would be queried happens before the configs are loaded.
 - 41.0.35 Fix EnumArgument to use enum names for suggestions (#8728)
           Previously, the suggestions used the string representation of the enum
           through Enum#toString, which can differ from the name of the enum as
           required by Enum#valueOf, causing invalid suggestions (both in gui and
           through the error message).

 - 41.0.16 Implement a simple feature system for Forge (#8670)
           * Implement a simple feature system for Forge. Allows mods to demand certain features are available in the loading system. An example for java_version is provided, but not expected to be used widely. This is more targeted to properties of the display, such as GL version and glsl profile.
           Requires https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeSPI/pull/13 to be merged first in ForgeSPI, and the SPI to be updated appropriately in build.gradle files.
           * rebase onto 1.19 and add in SPI update
 - 41.0.15 displayTest option in mods.toml (#8656)
           * displayTest option in mods.toml
           * "MATCH_VERSION" (or none) is existing match version string behaviour
           * "IGNORE_SERVER_VERSION" accepts anything and sends special SERVERONLY string
           * "IGNORE_ALL_VERSION" accepts anything and sends an empty string
           * "NONE" allows the mod to supply their own displaytest using the IExtensionPoint mechanism.
           * Update display test with feedback and added the mods.toml discussion in mdk.
 - 41.0.14 Update forgeSPI to v5 (#8696)

 - 41.0.3  Fire registry events in the order vanilla registers to registries (#8677)
           Custom registries are still fired in alphabetical order, after all vanilla registries.
           Move forge's data_serializers registry to forge namespace.
 - 41.0.2  Add method with pre/post wrap to allow setting/clearing mod context. (#8682)
           Fixes ActiveContainer in ModContext not being present in registry events. Closes #8680
 - 41.0.1  Fix the Curlie oopsie
 - 41.0.0  Forge 1.19
           * Bump pack.mcmeta formats
           * 1.19 biome modifiers
           * Mark ClientPlayerNetworkEvent.LoggedOutEvent's getters as nullable
           * Add docs and package-info to client extension interfaces package
           * Move RenderBlockOverlayEvent hooks to ForgeHooksClient
           * Add package-infos to client events package
           * Rename SoundLoadEvent to SoundEngineLoadEvent
           This reduces confusion from consumers which may think the
           name SoundLoadEvent refers to an individual sound being loaded rather
           than the sound engine.
           * Document and change SoundLoadEvent to fire on mod bus
           Previously, it fired on both the mod bus and the Forge bus, which is
           confusing for consumers.
           * Delete SoundSetupEvent
           Looking at its original implementation shows that there isn't an
           appropriate place in the new sound code to reinsert the event, and the
           place of 'sound engine/manager initialization event' is taken already by SoundLoadEvent.
           * Perform some cleanup on client events
            - Removed nullable annotations from ClientPlayerNetworkEvent
            - Renamed #getPartialTicks methods to #getPartialTick, to be consistent
             with vanilla's naming of the partial tick
            - Cleanup documentation to remove line breaks, use the
             spelling 'cancelled' over
             'canceled', and improve docs on existing and
              new methods.
           * Remove EntityEvent.CanUpdate
           Closes MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge#6394
           * Switch to Jetbrains nullability annotations
           * New PlayLevelSoundEvent; replaces old PlaySoundAtEntityEvent
           * Remove ForgeWorldPresetScreens
           * Remove IForgeRegistryEntry
           * Remove use of List<Throwable> in FML's CompletableFutures
           * Add docs to mod loading stages, stages, and phases
           * Gradle 7.4.2
           * Use SLF4J in FMLLoader and other subprojects
           * Switch dynamic versions in subprojects to pinned ones
           * Switch ForgeRoot and MDK to FG plugin markers
           * Configure Forge javadoc task
           The task now uses a custom stylesheet with MCForge elements, and
           configured to combine the generation from the four FML subprojects
           (fmlloader, fmlcore, javafmllanguage, mclanguage) and the Forge project
           into the javadoc output.
           * Update docs/md files, for 1.19 update and the move away from IRC to Discord.
           * Make "Potentially dangerous alternative prefix" a debug warning, not info.
